// Pure projection layer for ReviewPanel.
//
// ReviewPanel.ts (2,006 lines) owns DOM rendering; this module owns the
// decisions ReviewPanel makes about WHICH top-level layout fires and the
// small pure helpers it used to inline. Extracting these now — before
// splitting the panel into per-section files — gives the eventual split a
// frozen contract to refactor against. The fixtures in
// ReviewPanelViewModel.fixtures.ts are an active parity gate over the
// branch-selection logic.
//
// This module performs no DOM work, holds no state, and does not import
// Obsidian. It mirrors the pattern established by ToolbarStateInputs /
// ToolbarViewModel.
