=== EDIT ===
SceneId: scn_shail_begins_race_01
Original: She loses her exultant feeling quickly, replaced by a sense of disquiet.
Revised: She loses her exultant feeling instantly, replaced by disquiet.
Why: Tighten cadence.

=== CONDENSE ===
SceneId: scn_shail_begins_race_23
Target: Flight strategy paragraph (storm hopping, jet stream, altitude)
Suggestion: Reduce to 2–3 sharp lines focused on intent and risk.
Why: Maintain pacing during high-tension launch.

=== CUT ===
SceneId: scn_shail_begins_race_22
Target: Extended explanation of Tourney philosophy speech mid-action
Why: Info-dump during a critical moment.
