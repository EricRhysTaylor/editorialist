// Minimal transaction/repair primitive for review decisions.
//
// A review decision (reject / rewrite / defer / accept) performs an ordered
// sequence of authoritative mutations (registry decision index, UI store
// status) followed by derived re-projections (reviewer signals, scene
// inventory). If any step throws mid-sequence the prior steps must not be
// left silently committed. As each authoritative mutation succeeds the
// caller registers its inverse here; on failure the scope replays the
// inverses LIFO, best-effort, so the store status and the persisted
// decision index can never diverge from each other.
//
// Compensations are best-effort by design: a failing compensation must not
// mask the original error nor abort the remaining rollbacks. Reconciling
// the *derived* projections (signals / inventory) after rollback is the
// caller's responsibility — they are recomputed from the reverted
// authoritative state.
