# Editorialist Code Standards

This document captures rules we enforce in the Editorialist repository. Most
rules are machine-checked; deviations need a same-line `// SAFE:` comment
explaining the exception.

Enforcement scripts live in `/scripts`:

- `qa-audit.mjs` — general DOM / TypeScript hygiene (innerHTML, `any`, style
  attributes, SVG creation, etc.).
- `obsidian-compliance.mjs` — Obsidian Community Plugin submission rules
  (manifest validity, forbidden plugin patterns).
- `css-audit.mjs` / `css-drift-check.mjs` — CSS hygiene and drift.

All three run during `npm run check`, `npm run build`, and
`npm run release:check`, so violations block a build.

## 1. Obsidian submission rules

These rules come from the official Obsidian guidelines
(<https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines>) and from
patterns that the review team regularly flags on submission PRs. Breaking any
of these is a build failure.

### 1.1 `manifest.json`

- `id` must be lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, no `obsidian-` prefix.
- `name` must not contain the word "Obsidian".
- `description` must end in a period and stay under ~250 characters.
- `authorUrl` is required. The submission bot looks for it.
- `minAppVersion` must reflect a version you actually test against. Do not
  leave it at `0.15.0` just because the sample plugin does.
- `versions.json` must contain `{ [manifest.version]: manifest.minAppVersion }`.

### 1.2 `package.json`

- `obsidian` must be in `devDependencies`, never `dependencies`.
- Pin `obsidian` to a range, never `"latest"` or `"*"`.

### 1.3 Plugin lifecycle

- **Never call `workspace.detachLeavesOfType(...)` in `onunload()`** for a view
  type you registered. Obsidian restores workspace state on reload, and
  `registerView()` already handles cleanup. Detaching here wipes the user's
  open panels.
- Use `this.register*` helpers (`registerEvent`, `registerDomEvent`,
  `registerInterval`, `register`) so Obsidian guarantees cleanup. If you must
  use a raw `addEventListener`, wire the teardown into `onunload()`.
- Do not monkey-patch internal Obsidian methods.
- Do not ship default hotkeys for commands.

### 1.4 Labels and commands

- Ribbon icon labels, command names, and setting headings **must not** contain
  the plugin name. Obsidian adds the plugin name automatically, so including
  it produces "Editorialist: Editorialist Begin" style duplication.
- Command names should be descriptive verbs, not placeholders like
  "Begin" or "Start". They appear in the command palette alongside hundreds
  of other commands.
- The README command list must match the commands actually registered by
  `registerCommands()`. Reviewers check this.
- UI strings are sentence case (`obsidianmd/ui/sentence-case`). The rule fires
  only at UI call sites — `new Notice()`, `setPlaceholder()`, `createEl` text,
  `aria-label` — not at plain string constants.
- **Do not `eslint-disable` an `obsidianmd/*` rule.** The preset ships
  `eslint-comments/no-restricted-disable`, which reports the disable itself, so
  a suppression trades one problem for two. Fix the string instead.
- To keep a literal token out of the rule's reach, wrap it in backticks: the
  rule treats a backtick span as code and leaves its casing alone. This is how
  `%%ai:…%%` stays lowercase in UI copy — matching what `main.ts` actually
  writes into a note. Without backticks the rule "corrects" it to `%%AI:…%%`,
  which names a marker the plugin never emits.
- Prefer naming a marker over spelling it in an `aria-label`; the `%%…%%`
  delimiters are noise when spoken.

### 1.5 DOM and rendering

- No `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, or `insertAdjacentHTML`. Use
  `createEl` / `createDiv` / `setText` instead.
- No `element.className =` — use `classList.add/remove/toggle`.
- No inline styles via `style="..."` or `element.style.foo = "..."`.
- `element.style.setProperty("--css-var", value)` is allowed **only** for
  CSS custom properties. Hardcoding pixel/color values is not.
- SVG elements must be created with `document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, ...)`.
- Never `document.createElement(...)` for HTML. Use the `createEl` family. When
  an element must belong to the focused window's document (popout support), go
  through that document's node — e.g.
  `activeDocument.body.createDiv({ cls })` — not the global `createDiv()`,
  which always builds in the main document. `activeWindow.createDiv()` is what
  `obsidianmd/prefer-create-el` suggests, but it does not typecheck: obsidian's
  `Window` interface does not declare the `createEl` helpers.

### Settings tab rendering

`EditorialistSettingTab` renders imperatively via `display()` and does **not**
implement `getSettingDefinitions()` (Obsidian's declarative settings API,
1.13.0+). `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` ≥ 0.4.0 warns about this
(`obsidianmd/settings-tab/prefer-setting-definitions`); the warning is known and
accepted. Reasons:

1. Returning a non-empty definition array suppresses `display()` entirely, so
   there is no partial adoption. The tab is a bespoke three-tab dashboard
   (heroes, inventory, activity, contributor cards, maintenance), not a list of
   settings — only about five items are atomic knobs.
2. `getSettingDefinitions()` is synchronous, but rendering depends on awaited
   metadata (`syncOperationalMetadata`, `refreshPendingEditsSummary`).
3. `manifest.json` sets `minAppVersion: 1.7.2`; the API is 1.13.0+. Carrying
   both renderings would duplicate the whole tab and invite drift.

Accepted cost: these settings do not appear in Obsidian's settings search on
1.13+. Revisit when `minAppVersion` moves to 1.13.0.

### 1.6 Styling

- All colors come from Obsidian CSS variables (`--background-primary`,
  `--text-normal`, etc.). Hardcoded hex is banned, with one specific exception:
  **trademarked brand marks** (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Grok logos in
  `ContributorBrandMarks.ts`) may use their official brand colors. Any new
  exception must be documented at the top of the file with a brand/trademark
  justification.
- Prefer `color-mix(in srgb, var(--obsidian-var) x%, transparent)` for
  translucent surfaces so the result still tracks the theme.

### 1.7 Vault and filesystem access

- Prefer the Vault API (`app.vault.read`, `app.vault.modify`, `getAbstractFileByPath`, etc.).
- `app.vault.adapter` is allowed **only** when the target lives outside the
  Markdown-indexed vault — e.g. reading another plugin's `data.json` under
  `${vault.configDir}/plugins/...`. Document the reason with a one-line
  comment at the call site.
- Never hardcode absolute filesystem paths. Use `normalizePath` and vault
  APIs.

### 1.8 Network and telemetry

- No network requests without explicit user action.
- Use `requestUrl()` from `obsidian` for any HTTP call that might hit CORS.
- No analytics or telemetry, opt-in or otherwise, ship in this repo.

### 1.9 TypeScript hygiene

- No `any` / `as any` / `<any>` without a same-line `// SAFE:` comment
  explaining why.
- No `@ts-ignore`. `@ts-expect-error` is allowed **only** with a comment on
  the same line explaining what Obsidian API is missing.
- No `console.log` in `src/`. `console.error` / `console.warn` are allowed
  for genuine error paths.
- No `var`. Use `const` or `let`.

## 2. Release process

All of these rules are enforced by `scripts/obsidian-compliance.mjs`, which
runs as part of `npm run build`, `npm run check`, and `npm run release:check`.
If the compliance check fails, the build fails — fix the underlying issue
before retrying.

The release funnel:

```bash
# Sanity funnel — run as often as you like while developing.
npm run check              # typecheck + lint + css + qa-audit + compliance

# Full pre-release gate.
npm run release:check      # check + test + css-drift + build

# Phase 1: bump version, sync manifest+versions+package.json, rebuild,
# commit, tag (bare version), push main and the tag, and open a DRAFT
# GitHub Release with the generated changelog.
npm run release -- patch   # or: minor | major | x.y.z

# Phase 2: build, attest, and upload the three assets in CI, then ask
# before publishing the draft.
npm run release
```

`scripts/release.mjs` is two-phase. Phase 1 commits, tags, and pushes, then
creates the GitHub Release as a **draft** and opens it in the browser; the
release notes are edited there and the draft is saved, not published. Phase 2
dispatches the CI build, waits for the assets, and asks before publishing.
Publishing is the only step that makes a release public, and it always asks
first. Note that phase 1 does push: it is the one sanctioned push in the
repo's workflow, and it is Eric's to run.

### 2.1 GitHub Release requirements

The Obsidian community plugin updater fetches three files from the GitHub
Release matching the manifest version:

- `manifest.json`
- `main.js`
- `styles.css`

They must be attached as individual release assets — not zipped, not inside
a folder. The release tag must be the bare version string (e.g. `0.1.1`,
**not** `v0.1.1`).

### 2.2 First-time submission

For the initial community-plugin submission only, open a PR to
<https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases> adding this plugin to
`community-plugins.json`. Subsequent releases only require a new GitHub
Release on this repo — the Obsidian updater picks them up automatically.

## Obsidian scanner parity (added 2026-06-11)

The community directory's automated review runs MORE than the public
`eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` preset: typed deprecation detection against current
`obsidian` typings, a ban on `eslint-disable` directives for `no-console`, and
CSS feature checks. To keep local scans equivalent:

- `npm run lint:obsidian:report` now includes `@typescript-eslint/no-deprecated`.
- Weekly (or before any release): `npm install -D obsidian@latest eslint-plugin-obsidianmd@latest`
  then run the report. Stale typings hide new deprecations — that is how
  `setActiveLeaf` slipped through 1.0.0.
- Never add `eslint-disable` for `no-console`; the config allows
  `console.warn`/`console.error` for diagnostic surfaces.
